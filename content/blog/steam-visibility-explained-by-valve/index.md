Valve have published the slides for [Erik Peterson's recent talk on Steam visibility](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/SteamVisibility.pdf). It's a good overview of the discovery mechanisms happening behind the scenes. Here's my key takeaways.

## Visibility

- No widget on Steam is pay-to-win. They're all driven by **player interest** --- that is, revenue.

  > When players spend time and money on your game, itâ€™s a strong signal to Steam it could be interesting to other players, too.

- Some widgets are **algorithmic** (_Featured & Recommended_, _Discovery Queue_, _New & Trending_, _Top Sellers_, _Popular Upcoming_, _Specials_), while others are **curated** (_Home Page Takeover_, _Daily Deals_, _Midweek and Weekend Deals_).

- **Content hubs** are a big source of traffic. [<abbr title="Free To Play">F2P</abbr>](https://store.steampowered.com/genre/Free%20to%20Play) is extremely popular.

## Algorithmic

- Things that **don't affect** algorithmic visibility:

  - Store page traffic
  - Review score (usually)
  - Wishlists (usually)
  - Early Access (usually)

- Things that **do affect** algorithmic visibility:
  - Localization
  - Tags

## Curated

- Inclusion in curated widgets is based on **revenue**, and other customer signals. If you think you're doing good, it's worth **reaching out** to Valve.

- Maximize your chances of appealing to a **broad audience**:

  - Localization
  - Regional pricing
  - Marketing assets
  - Controller support
  - Community

## Launch

- Generate interest in your game as you get closer to release. Launch with **momentum**.

  - Discord, forums, social media
  - Press and influencers
  - Paid marketing
  - Local tradeshows, meetups, and groups

- There's **no shadowban**. _(Although that doesn't mean that you can turn around a bad launch.)_

  > Steam never makes a permanent decision about your game.
